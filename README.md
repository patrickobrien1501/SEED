# SEED
Statistical Exploration Environment for Data

In many engineering projects the aim is to obtain a good understanding of underlaying data. Let it be finding sensitivies or correlations of measurement
data (where inputs and outputs are known) or FE-model-based sensitivity studies in which the outputs, also called responses, are calculated and tracked.
Later these data can be used to derive response surfaces, mathematical models of the system's behavior, on which optimizations can be performed with
minimal time effort.

The aim is to provide a multidisciplinary design study program to explore and optimize data-based models. A smart combination of automated preprocessing, predictive modeling and data mining is utilized for design space exploration.

## Capabilities
Within our MPS history and grown skills over the past years we gained the theoretical as well as the pratical knowledge of how to perform such studies but
also how to develop tools that can mimic HyperStudy's functionalities.
The proposal is to create a browser-based environment that can be used by anyone within our company with as little effort as possible. Let it be experts
setting up complex FE-based non-linear optimizations or production and R&D engineers that want to explore and understand production and experimental
data up to making sense out of sales data.
